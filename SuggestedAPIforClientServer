minimalist application. 
1 client plays against server (house)
API: 
3 commands
start game (reset)  G
hit                 H
stand               S



game status:
- game running             R
- player lost, house won   L
- house lost, player won   W
- Illegal request	         I


On all 3 commands there will be a reply of the same format:

Game Status (R,L,W), Player Score (number), House Score (number (almost always 0))


Example: 
Command    Reply
G          (R,0,0)
H          (R,8,0)
H          (R,17,0)

H	   (L,22,0)
OR
S          (W,17,25)     or       S (L,17,20) 
	  

If client sends H or S while game is NOT running, reply with (I, 0, 0)


On G(start game) Server sets playerScore to 0


on start, game server will reset the score
on hit, server will:
score under or equal to 21
- if yes, draw card, add to score, check the score, define game status, reply
- if greater than 21, reply: game status (bust)
game over  





Status, PLayer Score, House Score         - needed for universal API


One person does server, one person does client
